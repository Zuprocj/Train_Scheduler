# Train_Scheduler

Created a train schedule application that incorpartes Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js.  The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  

Dealing with firebase proved difficult.  I couldn't set up a new Firebase database for the assignemnt; so, I used the database we created in class and it worked. Another issue that arose is that minutes until next arrival shows up as NaN and I couldn't figure out a way to display the current number of minutes.

# Getting started

Due to API issues, I am unable to deply the website app.  However, I have enabled the TA's of the class as collaborators and they are able to look over and grade the code.
